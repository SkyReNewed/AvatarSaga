# AvatarSaga

Welcome to AvatarSaga! This repository serves as a personal archive of my GitHub avatars. I use it to keep track of different profile images I've used over time.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document the evolution of my GitHub profile picture. It's a fun way for me to look back at the different "avatars" I've presented on the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into categories based on the general style or theme of the avatars:

- **`flat/`:** stack of overlapping circle or square images designed with flat design principles. Each image has no gradients, shadows, or texturesâ€”just bold, solid colors to represent profile pictures, creating a clean and modern aesthetic.
- **`minimalist/`:** A stack of overlapping circle or square images designed with minimalist principles. The design focuses on simplicity and functionality, using clean shapes, ample white space, and distinct solid colors to represent profile pictures in an uncluttered and elegant way.

**Note:** The categorization is subjective and based on my personal interpretation of the avatar's style.

## Naming Convention

Within each category folder, the filenames are generally descriptive and may include a brief description or approximate date (if known). For example:

- `minimalist/simple_avatar_1.png`
- `colorful/vibrant_profile.png`
- `professional/headshot_2022.jpg`

## Usage

This repository is primarily for my personal record-keeping. However, feel free to browse through the different folders and see the variety of profile pictures I've used!

## Contributing

Since this is a personal archive, contributions are not expected or accepted.

## License

This repository is intended for personal use. Unless otherwise specified, the images are my own creation or usage is within the terms of service of the respective platforms.
