# AvatarSaga

Welcome to AvatarSaga! This repository serves as a personal archive of my GitHub avatars. I use it to keep track of different profile images I've used over time.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document the evolution of my GitHub profile picture. It's a fun way for me to look back at the different "avatars" I've presented on the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into categories based on the general style or theme of the avatars:

- **`flat/`:** A stack of simple, overlapping circle or square icons, each representing a profile picture. Use different solid colors for each.

**Note:** The categorization is subjective and based on my personal interpretation of the avatar's style.

## Naming Convention

Within each category folder, the filenames are generally descriptive and may include a brief description or approximate date (if known). For example:

- `minimalist/simple_avatar_1.png`
- `colorful/vibrant_profile.png`
- `professional/headshot_2022.jpg`

## Usage

This repository is primarily for my personal record-keeping. However, feel free to browse through the different folders and see the variety of profile pictures I've used!

## Contributing

Since this is a personal archive, contributions are not expected or accepted.

## License

This repository is intended for personal use. Unless otherwise specified, the images are my own creation or usage is within the terms of service of the respective platforms.
